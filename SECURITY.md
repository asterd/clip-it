# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) or contact the maintainers directly.

Include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps / proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix, if available

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate responsible disclosure.
